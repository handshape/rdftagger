# rdftagger

A simple JavaFX app illustrating how RDF triples can be authored with as few user gestures as possible.

Build requires Maven and a Java 11 JDK to build and a Java 8/11 runtime with JavaFX built in. Azul ZuluFX is recommended, although Oracle's Java 8 will work -- be aware of Oracle's licensing restrictions! :
